# Deep-learning-for-human-behavior
Emeline and I are students in third year at university of Mons. We're electrical engineering student. During the second semester, we choose to work on real time human behavior analysis using deep learning. These project was presented by Sohaib Laraba and Thierry Dutoit. Our promoter, Sohaib Laraba, currently works on real time human behavior analysis using deep learning but with different methods. In agreement with him, we choose to work with the method of Nicholas Renotte (https://github.com/nicknochnack/ActionDetectionforSignLanguage) so see if we get better results. We made some changes and improvements to his methods. We worked with the software "Mediapipe" which work like OpenPose. It allows us to extract the keypoints from a RGB video. Then we made a few treatments to adapt the coordinates for the entry of the neural network.
We choose to work with LSTM.
